- For question 1, I assumed the quotes.txt file is in the same directory as the script file. I also wrote the code for scripts together.
- For question 2, I assumed the same pattern of sentences where the author is separated from their quote by a " ~" and also I have assumed that the quotes.txt file is in the same directory as the script
- For question 3, I assumed that the input file is supplied while running the script as "./q3.sh <input file name>". I have also converted the words to lowercase while checking for duplicates and used additional temprorary files that were later deleted in the script
- For question 4, I have assumed that the input is comma separated variables because that's how they appeared in the sample input
- For question 5, I have taken the input only once and performed all three functions on the same input
